# Called by git-commit with no arguments.  The hook should
# exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message if
# it wants to stop the commit.
#
# To enable this hook, make this file executable.

# This is slightly modified from Andrew Morton's Perfect Patch.
# Lines you introduce should not have trailing whitespace.
# Also check for an indentation that has SP before a TAB.
